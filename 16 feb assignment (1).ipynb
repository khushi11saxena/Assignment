    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is stored in a computer system. It is designed to efficiently manage, store, and retrieve data for various purposes, such as storing customer information, financial data, product inventory, or any other data that needs to be organized and easily accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases is the way they handle data relationships. SQL databases use tables and define relationships between tables using foreign keys, while NoSQL databases allow for more flexible data models and can store related data in a single document or record.\n",

    "\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a type of SQL command used to define the structure and layout of a database. It is a subset of SQL and is used to create, modify and delete the database schema and its objects such as tables, views, indexes, sequences, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common DDL commands are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1:CREATE: Used to create a new database or its objects such as tables, views, indexes, and sequences. For example, to create a new table named \"customers\" with columns \"customer_id\", \"first_name\", and \"last_name\", we would use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
    "   customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "   first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "   last_name VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "\n",
    "2:DROP: Used to remove an existing database or its objects such as tables, views, indexes, and sequences. For example, to drop the \"customers\" table that we created earlier, we would use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "3:ALTER: Used to modify the structure of an existing database or its objects such as tables, views, indexes, and sequences. For example, to add a new column named \"email\" to the \"customers\" table that we created earlier, we would use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "\n",
    "4:TRUNCATE: Used to remove all data from a table without removing the table structure itself. For example, to remove all the data from the \"customers\" table that we created earlier, we would use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE customers;"

    "\n",
    "  Primary Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "   A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. The primary key constraint ensures that the values in the column(s) are unique and cannot be null. The primary key is used to create relationships between tables and is used as a reference by foreign keys in other tables. For example, in a table of customers, the customer ID might be the primary key, as each customer would have a unique ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Foreign Key:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables. The foreign key constraint ensures that the values in the column(s) must exist in the referenced primary key column of another table, or must be null. For example, in a table of orders, there might be a foreign key that refers to the primary key of the customers table, indicating which customer placed the order."
